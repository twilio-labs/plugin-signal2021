[SIGNAL Developer Mode](https://twil.io/signal-developer-mode) is an augmentation for your experience at Twilio's [SIGNAL 2021 Conference](https://signal.twilio.com).

It's built on top of the [Twilio CLI](https://twil.io/cli) and provides functionality inside your terminal such as:
* __access to your full SIGNAL schedule__: view the entire SIGNAL and [SIGNAL TV](https://twitch.tv/twilio) schedule and register for any sessions you are interested in
* __a packed demo section__: explore code samples for a variety of Twilio use-cases and get started in minutes
* and more

# Requirements

## Setup

You'll need the [Twilio CLI](https://twil.io/cli) to run SIGNAL Developer Mode. Head over to the [Twilio CLI documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart) to install it.

Additionally, you'll need a ticket to SIGNAL 2021. Register for a free ticket on the [SIGNAL website](https://signal.twilio.com).

## Supported Terminals

SIGNAL Developer Mode should work in any terminal but some terminals might have limited functionality or [display flickering](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink/issues/359). 

Some of the terminals that we found that were doing a good job are: [Hyper](https://hyper.is), the built-in macOS Terminal.app and [cmder](https://cmder.net/) on Windows.

For terminals that have known flickering issues we try to detect that and reduce the amount of animations and screen updates. For more info on this check out the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

SIGNAL Developer Mode will also adapt based on the size of your terminal, however, the bigger your terminal window the better. Alternatively, you can change your terminal font size.

# Installation

```sh-session
$ twilio plugins:install @twilio-labs/plugin-signal2021
$ twilio --help signal2021
USAGE
  $ twilio signal2021
...
```

You'll be prompted for your SIGNAL credentials that you also use to [log into the SIGNAL 2021 website](https://signal.twilio.com/login).

> If you don't want to enter your email and password every time, you can also [store them as environment variables](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html) and pass them via the `--email` flags to `twilio signal2021`..
